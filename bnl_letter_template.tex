\opening{Dear Sir/Madam:}

Brookhaven National Laboratory is a multipurpose research institution
funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of
Science. Located on the center of Long Island, New York, Brookhaven
Lab brings world-class facilities and expertise to the most exciting
and important questions in basic and applied science-from the birth of
our universe to the sustainable energy technology of tomorrow.

We operate cutting-edge large-scale facilities for studies in physics,
chemistry, biology, medicine, applied science, and a wide range of
advanced technologies. The Laboratory's almost 3,000 scientists,
engineers, and support staff are joined each year by more than 4,000
visiting researchers from around the world. Our award-winning history
stretches back to 1947, and we continue to unravel mysteries from the
nanoscale to the cosmic scale, and everything in between.


\closing{Kind regards,}

\ps{P.S. We are GREAT!}
