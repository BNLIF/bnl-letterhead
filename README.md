# BNL Letterhead

The lab provides BNL "stationary" online at https://intranet.bnl.gov/stationary.

That material is for some marginal and ultimately doomed format called MicroSoft "Word".

For those people that write letters in the more vibrant and trusted format LaTeX, this repository will help.

## What's here?

* [bnlletter.sty](https://github.com/BNLIF/bnl-letterhead/blob/master/bnlletter.sty) the style file to use
* [bnl_letter_template.tex](https://github.com/BNLIF/bnl-letterhead/blob/master/bnl_letter_template.tex) an example of its use.  There is also the build [PDF](https://github.com/BNLIF/bnl-letterhead/blob/master/bnl_letter_template.pdf) (compare to the [PDF](https://github.com/BNLIF/bnl-letterhead/blob/master/letter.pdf) that the official [DOC](https://github.com/BNLIF/bnl-letterhead/blob/master/letter.doc) produces)

## How to use?

1. Copy the `bnlletter.sty` and the `*logo.*` files into your LaTeX project
2. Follow the `bnl_letter_template.tex` example.
